    "Early technology adopters: This group is more likely to be interested in new products like TiVo and have a higher willingness to purchase such products.\n",

    "Frequent purchasers: Customers who purchase electronics more frequently are more likely to be interested in new products and could be more receptive to marketing efforts.\n",
